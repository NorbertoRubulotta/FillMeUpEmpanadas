        <h2>OUR EMPANADAS</h2>
        <p>
          After serving thousands of empanadas from our food trucks in the
          country, we can proudly present a menu that is mouth-watering,
          diverse and challenging for the taste buds. We understand that there
          can be many different food preferences and allergies to a party and
          therefore our menu can be adapted to the individual. Our empanadas
          can be served on gluten-free options, for vegetarians we always have
          three different empanadas and we can also serve lactose -free and
          vegan empanadas.

        <h2>FOOD TRUCK FOR YOUR EVENT</h2>
        <p>
          Getting a food truck out to an event provides a very special

          and at the same time fall into conversation with each other. Over
          the last few years, we have served thousands of empanadas for a wide
          range of events in the city and experienced how a food truck brings
          more life to a party than ordinary table service.

            ordering the food truck to packing and driving was a neat and

            "We hire Fill Me Up! EMPANADAS for an event with 70 diners for a
            Friday bar which was to be held at our cocktail bar. They arrived
            1.5 hours before and made everything ready out in front of our
            location. The food and service were top notch! Can definitely be
            recommended."

            "We booked the food truck for our party for 60 people, where we
            had a number of requirements such as that part of the food should
            be vegan, gluten-free and lactose-free. All requirements were met
            and the food was nicely kept separate from each other. Highly
            recommended."
